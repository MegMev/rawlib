This library is used to store time event pulses with a fixed number of bins. It includes processes related to signal conditioning, such as signal shaping, deconvolution, pulse fitting, de-noising, FFT, common noise reduction, and related routines. It is capable to read different binary formats from different electronic systems into REST.

Please have a look to this library [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before pushing changes to this repository.
